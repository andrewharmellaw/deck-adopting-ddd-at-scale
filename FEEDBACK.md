## Considered improvements
### Words:
 * I (Andrew) need to learn things so I don't need notes
 * I (Andrew) want to check we signpost where we're going over the course of the talk
 * Shorten it (so we have time for Q&A)

### Slides:
 * I (Andrew) want to make the diagrams look nicer
 * I (Andrew) want the diagrams to build - ideally we can have some sort of "diagram space" which we build up in the imagination of attendees (that'll need animations).  It'd be cool if things echoed / repeated as we re-visited them)
 * I (Andrew) want to remove the lines from around the demon / ninja images
 * I (Andrew) want to fix some layouts - some slides look messy
 * I (Andrew) want to add some slide transitions so that it looks like the near enemy slides are above the rest of the slides.  (So it's clear we're telling a story which comes from real experiences, but pulling out general truths)
 * Make my (Andrews') bits more visual (more like Gayathri's)
 * Have some more visual cues as to the shape of the presentation.
 * Put all "problem summaries" on top of faded diagrams that they are commenting on
 * Make sure they are super-accessible
 * Put our twitter handles on the bottom of every slide

### Doing it:
 * A few more practice runs (mainly so I can learn my bits and be super-slick)
 * Get a working clicker.
