# Adopting Domain Driven Design at Scale
## MuCon 2019

# Hello
(Who we are)

---

## Agenda

---

## The Challenge

People _still_ don't get DDD
But its the best way that we know of to get large teams around large codebases
Whether you're doing Microservices, or a Modular Monolith

---

## Our Story

MoJ
(And some other bits before and after)

---

# Part 1: ...

---

Kill misconceptions:
* There is only one model (that there is only one of anything is a risky view in DDD)
* There is a blessed team responsible for "the domain model"
* 

---

## It's in the frikkin' book
* Work with the teams
* Work with the domain experts
* Work with the code
* Iterate

---

## Everyone get modelling
We're _all_ doing design
Draw pictures!
C4 is good for this (Simon Brown has training for Developers too)
Find champions (junior folks can actually be good for this)

---

## Find the model in the code
FEEL the code

---

## It's not your model, it's everyone's
Use tools to generate your models that everyone can use to edit
N.b. folks need to be confident in these tools, not just have access to them.
You need to over-communicate and over-share
You need to work with others to find it

---

## Find the Bounded Contexts
Event Storming is good for this, 
But Conway's Law is also a good bet

---

# Part 2: ...

---

## Context Map
(I used to think yiou found this via doing models)
(Now I've seen Event Storming at scale I realise there are other ways)

---

### End-to-End Flows
Do Event Storming
It's in the ThoughtWorks Tech Radar
It's great for the obvious reasons
But you also get Business and Tech working together
And _everyone_ is modelling

---

### You _can_ copy data

---

## This is best seen in Alberto Brandolini's ()->|()->() diagram

---

### Pick your battles
Don't spread yourself too thin
Don't waste time trying to convince everyone - some folks will come round to the idea, especially when they see it working

---

## Strategic Patterns

---

## Domain Vision

---

## It's in the frikkin' book
* Work with the teams
* Work with the domain experts
* Work with the code
* Iterate

---

# Stage 3: ...

---

## Consolidate / Fight

---

## Beware close enemies

---

## Core domain

---

## Generic Sub Domain
Lose some battles

---

## It's in the frikkin' book
* Work with the teams
* Work with the domain experts
* Work with the code
* Iterate

---

# Conclusion

* Don't get waylaid
* Have confidence - you're finding and iterating, and training
* You're the guide to the DDD Theme Park
