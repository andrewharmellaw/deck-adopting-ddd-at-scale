# Intro

	## near enemies
	## constraints
	## high stakes

# Where things were when Andrew started
	## BIG PICTURE: GROKK-ABILITY, END-TO-END-VIEW - (Where is the big picture?) INTRO TO THIS PART
	## CORE MODEL: DATA-NOT-PROCESS, MODELS - ("one model to rule them all", "data focussed")
	## (Pull lifecycle, object-based-split from Constraints slide under here)
	## OWNERSHIP - (Alone doing...), ("Ownership")
	## GROKK-ABILITY (Perception @Scale)
	## BCs (Naming Teams)

# BREATHER: The Legal Domain
	## Complex / Ripe for DDD

# DOING
	## GROKK-ABILITY / END-TO-END-VIEW - if we can't grokk it, how can anyone else?
	## DATA-NOT-PROCESS, CORE-DOMAIN - (Case is a case is a case, Shared Kernels and the Abstract Core, Mind the Gap)
	## END-TO-END-VIEW - "()->|()->()", "Visualisation", 
	## BCs - ("Icebergs and Icecubes", "splits vs silos")
	## MODELS->CODE - ("Looking through the crystal ball", "shortsight vs longsight", "[Generic Sub Domain]")
	## DOMAIN EXPERTS (good - ("[Andrew]") and bad -  "Distill... the noise", "driver for change")

# TRANSFORMATION
	## Iterate
	## IDEAS LEGACY - (DOMAIN VISION STATEMENT++, multiple models of the same thing, actors coming together, process-centric, etc.) 
	## CONTEXT MAP (TO-BE)
	## Talking to Domain Experts
	## Per-Team Context Maps ("Process - Before and After")
	## Tools and Methods
	
# Complicated Bits
	## CQRS good - history and replayable (core domains)
	## CQRS bad - end-to-end!!! devs don't think like this

# Conclusions
	## Modelling is not cheap
	## Asit / to be vicious circle
	## You _can_ copy data - look to the process
